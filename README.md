# The Adventures of Cal Q. Luz
a Math 6 project by [**Christian Dasalla**](https://github.com/xtianfdasalla), [**Lance De Castro**](https://github.com/lcpdecastro), & **Reggie Magalong**

## Summary
*The Adventures of Cal Q. Luz* follows the story of Calisto Quintanilla Lucero, a.k.a. **Cal Q. Luz**, a scholar in his sixth year in high school. As he faces the challenges brought about by math, he encounters what might be the biggest problem he has ever imagined: differential and integral calculus.

2. [**Reverse Power Rule** (Integration)](https://xtianfdasalla.github.io/m6q2proj/2/)
3. [**Product Rule** (Differentiation)](https://xtianfdasalla.github.io/m6q2proj/3/)
4. [**Quotient Rule** (Differentiation)](https://xtianfdasalla.github.io/m6q2proj/4/)

Also available is a game featuring randomly generated polynomials and various configuration options that affect its difficulty; this can be found [here](https://xtianfdasalla.github.io/m6q2proj).
